My name is Julian Engelhardt. I am a software developer who mainly works on backend and cloud infrastructures in a DevOps-like way, but also does mobile and front-end development.

Currently I am the lead dev of the IoT cloud platform of a german temperature controller manufacturer.

You can also find me on [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github].
