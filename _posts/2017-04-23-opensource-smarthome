# The open source centric smart home

Over the last two years or so, I adopted some smart home devices one by one. By now, I have connected devices for different aspects of my day to day life that serve me well.
However, when using multiple systems, you get to a point where you get annoyed by having to control every device with a different App and want scenes and configurations across different devices. 
After having some discussions on twitter [and being explicitly asked about it](https://twitter.com/oxygen0211/status/855782919725514754), I want to share the my opinion about the devices I own and the approach I took for combining them.

## Covered usecases
As a developer seeing products and frameworks come and go, I didn't want to use one system for everything that will lock me in and want to at least have the option to some hacking on the systems on my own, so I want the components and software in use to be open source or at least to have a relatively open API.
And since I am living in a rented apartment, pulling wires to all the rooms and installing components into the surge cabinet is not an option. Through this, the older systems based on a central Bus like KNX are not that interresting to me and I tend to go more towards the new, wireless and specialized products. 
Of course, this makes interconnection more difficult, but since wanted some automation across all devices, this was my main focus over the last couple weeks. For automation, I wanted things like:

* React to time and weather (turn on the lights on sunset)
* Centrally manage scenes (Light color and brightness, music, ...) for certain occasions (TV watching, Party, Going to bed,...)
* React to me being present or not (make sure the lights are off when I'm gone)
* Make my apartment react to events happening online (change the light color when I'm mentioned on Twitter, react to data in my fitness Apps)
* Adapt all smart devices based on operation of another one (set a dedicated light scene when turning on the TV)
* Start routines including multiple devices (wake me up using Music AND Light)

While the implementation of some of these automations is still work in progress, I managed to find a combination as a platform that allows me to do all that. Here's how it's built.

## Devices

### Phillips Hue lightbulbs
These are certainly my most used components. Two years ago, I got myself a Hue starter kit with three E27 Bulbs since I wanted something cool for my sleeping room ceiling light.
This is still in daily use (meaning that I am still using the version 1 bridge which lacks some functionality that the new one has, making some things seem more complicated than they are).
After having installed one in my sleeping room, I used the other two as a ceiling light in my home office and as an ambient light in my living room.
A few weeks ago, I added two E10-Spots to my doorway, a portable Hue Go lamp as a second ambient spot in my living room and a light strip for lighting the edge of my bed.
I am pretty pleased with the bulbs, the E27 are fairly bright, The E10 are not as powerful but four of them would still be sufficient to light my doorway (currently I am using two hues and two normal LED spots since I still had them spare).
The only thing I would consider somewhat negative are that all the components are fairly pricy and that I hat some initial trouble getting the Lightstrip to stick. The adhesive that was on there by default just wouldn't hold to the wood of my bed enough. However this was easily fixed with proper doublesided tape.

I think other bulbs of this kind like Lifx or the new Ikea ones are a equally good option, however, I don't have first hand experience with them and haven't seen the need to introduce a second system by now.
