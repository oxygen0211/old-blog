Hi everyone and thanks for visiting my Blog.

My name is Julian Engelhardt and I am software developer who mainly works on backend and cloud infrastructures in a DevOps-like way, but also does some
mobile and front-end development. Currently I am the lead dev of a IoT cloud platform at a german temperature controller manufacturer.

In this blog I want to share some of my insights that I get in my daily work (as far as I can) and pet projects.

You can also find me on [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github].
