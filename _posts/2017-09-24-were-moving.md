# We're moving

In the last days I made the decision to move this blog to medium. While I will keep the site up a while longer, I will from now on post new entries on my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@oxygen0211).

There are several reasons for this:

* I post very infrequently. Between my day job, [my biggest side project](http://www.rides-moto.com) and several other hobbies, there are no frequent time slots to produce content or do maintenance on my blog. A shared platform makes it way easier to use these rare time slots to get out quality content instead of also having to fit site maintenance into them.

* Site design is not my strength. As you can see, this site uses a very basic design. This is because designing good looking sites is not my strength. It takes me a lot of time to wrap my head around design and creating sites that are appealing. Since a shared platform will take this burden off of my back, I am glad if I can outsource it.

* Visibility on the internet is hard. The hardest part of publishing content on the internet is getting people to find it. Gaining traffic on a site - especially with infrequent updates - needs much work. While a blogging platform does not guarantee you more visibility, it will at least help you by already having much more traffic than most private blogs (or at least mine!) and being able to drive users to your content by things like cross-referencing with similar content of other users.

If you liked what I have posted so far, I would be very happy if you follow me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@oxygen0211) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/oxygen0211).
